Crop Prediction Based on Soil and Climate

Overview

This project focuses on predicting the most suitable crops to grow in a specific region based on soil and climatic conditions. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, the system helps farmers and agricultural planners make informed decisions to maximize yield and sustainability.

Features

Input Parameters:

Soil properties: pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, organic carbon, etc.

Climatic data: temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.

Location-specific data (optional).

Output: Recommended crops ranked by suitability.

Machine Learning Models:

Classification algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and SVM.

Regression models for yield prediction (optional).

User Interface:

Interactive web or mobile application (optional).

Visualization of input data and recommendations.
